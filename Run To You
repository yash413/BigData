She says her love for me could never die
But that’d change if she ever found out about you and I

Oh, but her love is cold
It wouldn’t hurt her if she didn’t know, ’cause…

When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch

I’m gonna run to you
I’m gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling’s right
I’m gonna run all night
I’m gonna run to you

She’s got a heart of gold she’d never let me down
But you’re the one that always turns me on
You keep me comin’ ’round

I know her love is true
But it’s so damn easy makin’ love to you

I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

I’m gonna run to you
Yeah! I’m gonna run to you
Cause when the feeling’s right
I’m gonna stay all night
I’m gonna run to you

Yeah! I’m gonna run to you
Oh when the feeling’s right
I’m gonna run all night
I’m gonna run to you

(Oh when the feeling’s right now)
(Oh…)

Oh! I’m gonna run to you
Yeah! I’m gonna run to you
Cause when the feeling’s right
I’m gonna stay all night
I’m gonna run to you

Oh! I’m gonna run to you
Yeah! When the feeling’s right
I’m gonna stay all night
Oh when the feeling’s right now

Oh yeah when the feeling’s right now
I’m gonna run to you
Oh, oh

Yeah, I’m gonna run to you
Yeah, I’m gonna…
Oh, I’m gonna run to you, run to you
Oh, I’m gonna run to you
Oh
Oh, I’m gonna run now
